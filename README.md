Tool for public/private telegram channel backup.

Want to save some stuff from channel which is about to be removed, but manual forwarding takes too long?
Well, here is a tool for you.

## Retrieving channels

```
python3 tcb.py retrieve_channels --api_key 888888:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef --session sessionfile
```

*api_key* argument is simply *api_id:api_hash*, if you don't know what is it and how to get it, read [this](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)

Output will look something like this:

```
